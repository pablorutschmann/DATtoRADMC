#v1.2.1
*  actually extend all fields with repeating outermost layers, except for density, which is still extended with a gaussian.

#v1.2
* added feature, which allows to fetch all the features/fields from the data directory.

#v1.0.2
* fixed a bug where if you extend but not mirror it would crash.

#v1.0.1
* changed the way you set the extension. Now only need to input the number of cells to extend by. `0` corresponds to no extension. No longer a need for boolean input.

#v1.0
